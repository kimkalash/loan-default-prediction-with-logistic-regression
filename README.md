# Fintech Loan Default Prediction Pipeline (Logistic Regression)

## Overview
This project builds a production-grade machine learning pipeline to predict the probability of loan default in the fintech sector.  It uses Logistic Regression as the baseline model for interpretability and compliance, with extensibility for future models.  

The pipeline is designed with:
- Baseline Guarantees: Modularity, Explainability, Scalability, Security, Monitoring, Human-in-the-Loop
- Fintech Priority Features: Real-time scoring, Compliance Toggles, Risk-Sensitive Thresholding

## Goals
- Predict loan default probability at both batch and real-time scales
- Provide transparent, regulator-ready explanations for every prediction
- Reduce Non-Performing Loan (NPL) ratios without sacrificing loan approval rates
- Build a sustainable, maintainable pipeline that evolves over time

## Key Questions
1. What applicant and loan features are the strongest predictors of default?  
2. What probability thresholds balance risk appetite and profitability?  
3. How can predictions be integrated directly into loan origination workflows?  

## Metrics

Baseline Metrics
- Precision, Recall, F1
- ROC-AUC
- Accuracy (supportive)

Fintech-Specific Metrics
- KS Statistic / Gini Coefficient
- Calibration (Brier Score, Reliability Curves)
- Cost-Sensitive Metrics (FN > FP)
- Business KPIs (NPL percentage, approval rate, profit impact)

## Project Roadmap

1. Problem Framing
- Define problem, context, hypotheses, and constraints

2. Data Lifecycle
- Sources: Internal loan applications, repayments, credit bureau data
- Cleaning: Missing values, outliers, duplicates
- Feature Engineering: Ratios, behavioral, categorical encodings
- Splits: Train, Validation, Test with temporal awareness

3. Model Development
- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Regularization and calibration
- Explainability via coefficients and SHAP
- Risk band thresholds (low, medium, high)

4. Pipeline Architecture
- Ingestion: Batch and streaming (Kafka)  
- Processing: Feature store, validation (Great Expectations)  
- Model Serving: FastAPI microservice (REST or gRPC)  
- Orchestration: Airflow, Prefect, or AWS Step Functions  
- Storage: PostgreSQL, S3  
- Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, MLflow, EvidentlyAI  
- Security: IAM, RBAC, encryption, PII masking  

5. Delivery and Adoption
- API integrations for loan origination systems  
- Risk dashboards for officers  
- Compliance console with audit reports and retrain logs  
- Model card and whitepaper for regulators  

6. Maintenance and Governance
- Scheduled and drift-triggered retraining  
- Model registry with versioning  
- Feedback loop from analysts to retraining set  
- Governance: approval workflows and access controls  

## Baseline Service Guarantees
- Modularity and Pluggability  
- Transparency and Explainability  
- Scalability  
- Security by Default  
- Monitoring and Drift Detection  
- Human in the Loop Ready  

## Fintech Priority Features
- Real-Time Processing  
- Compliance Toggles (PCI, KYC, AML)  
- Risk-Sensitive Thresholding  

## Deliverables
- Logistic Regression model and API service  
- Risk Dashboard (portfolio and applicant level)  
- Compliance-ready audit logs  
- Documentation (model card, pipeline diagram, deployment guide)
